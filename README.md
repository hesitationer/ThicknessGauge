# ThicknessGauge

This project was my internship project which is able to measure the height of an object.
It was achieved using a GC-2450 camera and a laser.
The target was to be able to detect a high differential of just 0.1mm, which is a fraction of a pixel size.

It was developed using C++ and OpenCV (w. PvAPI to connect to camera).

Furthermore, it was a feasability study.

Several interesting problems were overcome (to an acceptable degree) and it was necessary to include a lot of utility functionality.

It is released under the BOOST license (see license file) in the hopes that others could benifit from it in some way :).
